## Getting Started

My interest in technology began with practical curiosity. I wanted to understand how software actually works, not just use it. This led to experimenting with programming fundamentals and building small projects to learn by doing.

I discovered that real learning happens when you break things, fix them, and understand the reasons behind the solutions.

---

## Development Foundation

I started with core web technologies:
- HTML and CSS for structure and styling
- JavaScript for functionality and user interaction
- Basic programming principles and problem-solving approaches

Early projects were straightforward but functional. Seeing my code work in the browser provided the motivation to continue improving and building more complex applications.

---

## Backend Development

As projects grew more complex, I needed data persistence, user authentication, and business logic. This led me to backend development with Python and Django.

I focused on:
- REST API development
- Database design and management
- Authentication and authorization systems
- Full-stack application architecture

Backend development required thinking about system design, data flow, and application architecture beyond just user interface.

---

## Project Approach

I build applications that solve real problems rather than theoretical exercises. Each project follows practical development principles:
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Efficient database design
- Scalable architecture patterns
- Proper API design
- Deployment-ready setup

Quality matters more than quantity. Fewer projects, done properly, create more impact.

---

## Learning Approach

Most of my learning comes from:
- Debugging broken systems
- Refactoring poor code
- Understanding trade-offs in design decisions
- Improving performance and maintainability

Every challenge improves judgment. Every mistake adds context.

Writing code is easy. Writing code that survives change is the real skill.

---

## Knowledge Sharing

I regularly help peers and juniors understand programming fundamentals and web development concepts. Teaching forces clarity and exposes gaps in understanding.

If I cannot explain something simply, I revisit it until I can.

---

## Current Focus

Right now, I am focused on:
- Backend development with Django and Django REST Framework
- API design and authentication
- Database modeling
- Writing clean, production-ready code
- Improving system design skills

I avoid hype-driven learning and focus on technologies that are actually used in real jobs.

---

## Future Goals

My goals moving forward:
- Build production-grade backend systems
- Improve scalability and system design knowledge
- Work on real products, not just practice applications
- Contribute to meaningful software projects

I am building long-term skills, not quick wins.

---

## Personal Approach

I value clarity, consistency, and deep technical understanding. I enjoy focused problem solving and continuously refining how I build software.

Progress matters more to me than noise.
